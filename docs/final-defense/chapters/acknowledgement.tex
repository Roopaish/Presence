We would like to express our gratitude to the many individuals who played a vital role in making the 
"Automated Face Attendance System" project a reality. Their support and guidance were crucial throughout the project, and we are sincerely thankful for their contributions.\\

We extend our special thanks to Mr.Birendra Bista, the Head of the Department of Software Engineering, for his invaluable guidance and technical support. Also our professor Dr. Roshan Chitrakar, for valuable suggestions, attention and time for our project. \\

 We also appreciate our supervisor Yogesh Deo, for constant motivation and support during the course of our work throughout the semester which helped our project to grow and foster to a certain level we didnâ€™t think of reaching in such a short period.  We truly appreciate and value his esteemed guidance and encouragement from the beginning to the end of this project.\\ 

Above all, we would like to thank our friends whose direct and indirect support helped us to complete our project on time. This project would have been impossible without their moral support.
