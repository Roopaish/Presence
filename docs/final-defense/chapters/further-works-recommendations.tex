\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf {Record attendance for each subject}: For now we are only recording attendance for a day. In future We will add functionality to record the attendance of each subject for better reports and insights.

\item \textbf { Enhance Facial Recognition Accuracy}: improving the facial recognition algorithms to ensure high accuracy, especially in challenging conditions, such as low light or varying student appearances (e.g., facial hair, makeup, or accessories).

\item \textbf{ Mobile Integration}: Develop a mobile app for students to easily track their attendance using their smartphones, providing an additional convenience layer to the system.

\item \textbf{ Customization Options}: Provide customization features that allow educational institutions to tailor the system to their specific needs, including attendance policies and reporting formats.
