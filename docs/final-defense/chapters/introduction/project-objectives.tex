To address these challenges, developed a face detection and recognition system called "Presence." The "Presence" system is an automated attendance system that utilizes facial recognition technology to identify and mark the attendance of students attending a lecture in a classroom. By automating the attendance process, "Presence" aims to save time for instructors, reduce errors, and provide a more accurate and efficient way to monitor student attendance.\\

The project had put forward the following objectives:

\begin{itemize}
	\item To automate attendance system for college classrooms
	\item To provide insights into attendance patterns and behavior.
        \item To support data-driven decision-making for improved student success.
  
\end{itemize}
