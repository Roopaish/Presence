 We understood the significance of time and aimed to make the most of our development period by maximizing our progress.Within this timeframe, we have made significant progress and successfully completed the following tasks:\\

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Research and Requirements Gathering}: Conducted thorough requirement gathering to ensure alignment with project objectives and user needs.
\item \textbf {Design and User Interface Development}: Successfully designed the system architecture and developed a user-friendly interface including login, sign up, forget password functionality, admin panel, and dashboard.
\item \textbf
{Face Detection and Recognition Technology}: Researched and implemented advanced face detection and recognition technology for accurate attendance tracking.
\item \textbf { Dataset and Model Training}: Made a portal to gather dataset images from students and train the facial recognition model using OpenCV for accurate attendance tracking.
\item\textbf { Database Design and Implementation}: We have successfully designed and implemented the necessary tables, relationships, and entities to store student information, attendance records, and other relevant data while prioritizing efficiency, scalability, and data integrity.
\item\textbf{REST API and websockets}: We connected the backend and frontend using REST APIs for on-demand communication and WebSockets for real-time communication while securing every APIs.
\end{itemize}


By completing these major tasks, we are progressing towards achieving our project goals of developing an automated attendance system that effectively tracks and analyzes student attendance.
