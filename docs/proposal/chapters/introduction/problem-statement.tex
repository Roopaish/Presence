In today's technology-driven era, the trend is to switch from traditional systems to fast, smart, and interactive systems that can be linked to web applications, enabling users to access the system from anywhere at any time. In academic settings, regular attendance is crucial for students to acquire knowledge, participate in class discussions, and engage with their peers. However, traditional methods of taking attendance, such as calling out names or manually signing in, can be tedious, prone to errors, and inefficient.\\

The "Presence" project is being developed to address the challenges associated with manual attendance-taking in college classrooms. Traditional methods of attendance tracking, such as paper sign-ins or roll calls, are time-consuming, prone to errors, and may not provide accurate or timely data for instructors and administrators. Additionally, manual attendance-taking does not provide insights into student behavior or attendance patterns, which can be valuable for improving academic outcomes and making data-driven decisions.
