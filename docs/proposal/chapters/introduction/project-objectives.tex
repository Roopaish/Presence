To address these challenges, we propose the design and implementation of a face detection and recognition system called "Presence." The "Presence" system is an automated attendance system that utilizes facial recognition technology to identify and mark the attendance of students attending a lecture in a classroom. By automating the attendance process, "Presence" aims to save time for instructors, reduce errors, and provide a more accurate and efficient way to monitor student attendance.\\

The proposed project has put forward the following objectives:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Develop an automated attendance system for college classrooms
	\item Provide insights into attendance patterns and behavior.
        \item Support data-driven decision-making for improved student success.
  
\end{itemize}
