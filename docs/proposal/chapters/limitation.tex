The following are the limitations of the project that are realized:
\begin{itemize}
 	
        \item The system may not work accurately in low lighting or poor camera quality environments.
        \item The system will have difficulty detecting faces if students are wearing masks or other facial coverings.
        \item Potential technical issues or errors with sensors and data analysis algorithms.
	\item Lack of consideration for the specific reasons behind student exits, such as temporary absences or emergencies.


 \end{itemize}
